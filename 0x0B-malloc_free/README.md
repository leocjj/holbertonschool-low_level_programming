# Project 0x0B.

C - malloc, free

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.

### Requirements

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc and free. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
Don’t forget to push your header file

```
You do not have to learn about calloc and realloc.
```

### Tasks

00 - function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
01 - function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
02 - function that concatenates two strings.
03 - function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
04 - function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
05 - function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.
06 - function that splits a string into words.
