# Project 0x1E.

Search Algorithms


## Read or watch:

    Search algorithm
    Space complexity (1)


## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.

    What is a search algorithm
    What is a linear search
    What is a binary search
    What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Requirements

### General


    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, … is forbidden.
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file
    All your header files should be include guarded

## More Info

You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:

    O(1)
    O(n)
    O(n!)
    n*m -> O(nm)
    n square -> O(n^2)
    sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
    log(n) -> O(log(n))
    n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
    …
